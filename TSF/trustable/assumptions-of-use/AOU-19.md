As long as the nlohmann/json library is actively used within eclipse-score/inc_nlohmann_json, the system integrator shall regularly review the available monitoring indicators (e.g. CI metrics such as test coverage and PR gate results, and any future runtime indicators) to detect adverse trends or threshold violations. For each identified trend or violation, the integrator shall initiate appropriate corrective actions (e.g. blocking the affected change, creating an issue, or triggering a root-cause analysis) and track them to closure.
